		<section class='content Solaris'>
			<div class='title'>Solaris (1972)</div>
			<div class='info'> Solaris is a 1972 film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The plot centers on a space station orbiting the fictional planet Solaris, where a scientific mission has stalled because the skeleton crew of three scientists have fallen into emotional crises. Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Banionis) travels to the station in order to evaluate the situation, only to encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others. The film was Tarkovsky's attempt to bring a new emotional and intellectual depth to the science fiction genre; he viewed most western works in the genre as shallow due to their focus on technological invention.</div>
